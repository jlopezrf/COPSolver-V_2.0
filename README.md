# COPSolver-V_2.0
This repository constains the code of my master thesis.
It is a framework written in X10 languaje (An IBM project) which offers several metaheuristics to work in Combinatorial Optimization.
It also offers parallel execution based on the confugiration of X10 platform.

(Unfortunatelly X10 languaje does not reach a "production grade" and so it is not a useful)
